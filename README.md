# Weather API Project

## Overview
This project is a simple Weather API that provides real-time weather data for any location. It fetches data from an external weather service and presents it in a user-friendly format.

## What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. In this case, the Weather API acts as an intermediary, fetching weather information from an external service and returning it in a structured format (such as JSON) that developers can use in their projects.

## Features
- Get current weather data for any location
- Fetch temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more
- Support for multiple locations
- Easy-to-use API endpoints

## How to Include This API in Your Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-api.git
 cd weather-api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:
```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Get an API Key
This project requires an API key from a weather service (such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI). Sign up and get your API key, then create a `.env` file and add:
```env
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 4. Run the Server
Start the API server with:
```sh
npm start
```

### 5. Use the API
You can now make requests to the API:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/weather?city=London
```
Example response:
```json
{
  "temperature": "18Â°C",
  "humidity": "78%",
  "wind_speed": "10 km/h"
}
```
